## 1. Summary

This proposal establishes the client-side architectural paradigm for `yoto-bench`, evaluating Single-Page Application (SPA) vs. Multi-Page Application (MPA) architectures and defining the routing model using **`@lit-labs/router`**.

---

## 2. Evaluation: SPA vs. MPA

### The Multi-Page Application (MPA) Approach
In a traditional MPA, navigating between distinct views (e.g. from `/library` to `/editor` or `/importer`) triggers full browser document reloads.
- *Disadvantage 1 (Connection Teardown):* Yoto player telemetry and remote commands require an active WebSocket connection to AWS IoT Core (`wss://`). An MPA terminates and re-handshakes this connection on every link click.
- *Disadvantage 2 (Interrupted Transfers):* Ingestion of podcast feeds or large batches of local audio files involves multi-step SHA-256 calculation, presigned S3 uploads, and transcode polling. Page reloads abort these active background operations.
- *Disadvantage 3 (Asset Re-Evaluation):* Icon catalog JSON indices and search caches would need to be reloaded into browser memory on every page.

### The Single-Page Application (SPA) Approach
- **Decision:** Build `yoto-bench` as an SPA.
- In-memory state, live WebSockets, background upload tasks, and indexed icon data persist seamlessly across view changes.

## 3. Routing Engine: `@lit-labs/router`

Rather than adopting heavy monolithic framework routers, `yoto-bench` uses **`@lit-labs/router`**:
1. **Lightweight & Native:** Designed specifically for Lit components, integrating directly with component lifecycles and reactive properties.
2. **HTML5 History API:** Provides clean URL paths without relying on hash fragments (`#`).
3. **Declarative Route Table:** Maps routes directly to view components (e.g., `/`, `/cards/:id`, `/import/podcast`, `/device`, `/privacy`).

## 4. Netlify SPA Fallback & Missing Asset 404 Guard (`netlify.toml`)

To allow client-side URL routing without returning 404s on page refresh or deep linking, while ensuring missing static assets return a true `404` instead of an HTML shell:

```toml
# ==============================================================================
# SPA Single-Entrypoint Fallback & Asset Guard for @lit-labs/router
# See: docs/rfcs/003-client-spa-and-routing-strategy.md
# ==============================================================================

# 1. Missing Asset Guard: Any non-existent asset request under /assets/* immediately
#    returns a real 404 rather than falling through to index.html (which would cause
#    MIME-type errors on broken scripts or images). Existing physical files on disk
#    are always served directly because force defaults to false.
[[redirects]]
  from = "/assets/*"
  to = "/404.html"
  status = 404

# 2. SPA Single-Entrypoint Fallback: Any other non-file request routes to index.html
#    with HTTP 200, allowing @lit-labs/router to parse and render dynamic view paths.
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
