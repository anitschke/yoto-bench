# Architecture & System Design (`yoto-bench`)

This document details the high-level architecture of `yoto-bench` (publicly known as **YotoBench**). To keep documentation accurate, granular implementation details are maintained in the codebase comments and type definitions, while this document focuses on architectural topology, security boundaries, hosting/staging patterns, and data flow patterns.

---

## 1. System Topology Overview

`yoto-bench` is an entirely client-side Single-Page Application (SPA) built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/) and hosted statically on **Netlify**. It communicates directly with Yoto cloud APIs and device brokers:

## 2. Hosting, Staging, & Deployment Pipeline

### Platform: Netlify + GitHub Actions
The project uses GitHub Actions for compilation and Netlify for static asset delivery as detailed in [RFC 001: Hosting Platform & Staging Strategy](rfcs/001-hosting-and-staging-strategy.md):
- **Framework-Agnostic Static Pipeline:** Built with Vite inside GitHub Actions and published as static assets adhering to standard `[name]-[hash].[ext]` naming.
- **Automated PR Deploy Previews:** Every pull request automatically generates an isolated, ephemeral preview environment (e.g. `https://deploy-preview-12--yoto-bench.netlify.app`), allowing team members to test features before merging.
- **Zero-Risk Billing:** Free tier includes hard-stop policies preventing unexpected overage charges.
- **Custom Headers (`netlify.toml`):** Fingerprinted assets in `/assets/*` are marked immutable with 1-year cache headers (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`), while the HTML entrypoint is set to `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`.

### Automated End-to-End Verification (Playwright)
- Automated Playwright suites run against pull request deploy preview URLs and production deployments in CI.
- Verification uses a dedicated, isolated non-production Yoto account to validate authentication, playlist operations, and icon selection without impacting personal hardware.

## 3. Client Architecture & SPA Routing

The frontend is structured as a Single-Page Application using **`@lit-labs/router`** as detailed in [RFC 003: Client-Side SPA & Routing Strategy](rfcs/003-client-spa-and-routing-strategy.md):
- **Why SPA over MPA:**
  - Maintains persistent WebSocket connections to Yoto's AWS IoT MQTT broker for live player updates.
  - Allows background audio processing and uploads to proceed uninterrupted while navigating the UI.
  - Keeps pre-indexed icon catalogs and search indices loaded in memory.
- **Reusable Widget System (`src/widgets/`):** All interactive primitives (buttons, inputs, modal dialogs, status badges, pixel displays) are standardized custom elements prefixed with `yb-` to maintain UI consistency across routes per [RFC 021: Project Rebranding & Naming Strategy](rfcs/021-project-rebranding-and-naming-strategy.md).

---

## 4. Authentication & Security Flow (OAuth 2.0 PKCE)

The application acts as an OAuth 2.0 **Public Client** registered with the Yoto Developer Portal as detailed in [RFC 007: OAuth Client Registration & Ephemeral PR Preview Redirect Strategy](rfcs/007-oauth-client-id-and-pr-preview-redirects.md).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant App as Browser App (Lit)
    participant Auth0 as Yoto Auth (login.yotoplay.com)
    participant API as Yoto API (api.yotoplay.com)

    User->>App: Click "Sign In with Yoto"
    App->>App: Generate random code_verifier and code_challenge (S256)
    App->>App: Save code_verifier & state to sessionStorage
    App->>Auth0: Redirect to /authorize?response_type=code&code_challenge=...
    Auth0-->>User: Present Yoto login screen
    User->>Auth0: Authenticate & consent
    Auth0-->>App: Redirect to callback URL with ?code=...&state=...
    App->>App: Verify state matches sessionStorage
    App->>Auth0: POST /oauth/token (code + code_verifier via browser fetch)
    Auth0-->>App: Return access_token & refresh_token
    App->>App: Store tokens in persistent browser storage (localStorage)
    App->>API: Authorized requests with Bearer access_token
```

## 5. Audio Ingestion & Podcast Sync Architecture

Detailed in [RFC 010: Podcast RSS Importer & Card Sync](rfcs/010-podcast-rss-importer-and-card-sync.md) and [RFC 008: Audio Ingestion, ZIP Extraction, and Upload Concurrency](rfcs/008-audio-ingestion-zip-and-upload-concurrency.md):

1. **Audio File Processing:** Audio files from folder drag-and-drop or direct podcast MP3 downloads are buffered in the Origin Private File System (OPFS).
2. **SHA-256 Hashing:** Browser computes `crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', buffer)` to obtain the base64url content hash.
3. **Deduplication Check:** The client calls `GET /media/transcode/audio/uploadUrl?sha256=...`. If the audio already exists on Yoto servers, the upload is skipped entirely.
4. **Direct-to-S3 Upload:** New audio is streamed directly to the presigned AWS S3 upload URL via `PUT` with controlled concurrency (max 3–4 parallel streams).
5. **Transcode Polling:** The app polls `GET /media/upload/:uploadId/transcoded` until Yoto's transcode pipeline finishes.
6. **Card Metadata Sync:** The card playlist definition (`/content`) is updated with new chapter and track structures.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant App as Browser App
    participant YotoAPI as Yoto REST API
    participant S3 as AWS S3 Storage
    participant Transcoder as Yoto Transcoder

    App->>App: Compute SHA-256 hash of audio stream
    App->>YotoAPI: GET /media/transcode/audio/uploadUrl (hash)
    alt Audio already exists on Yoto
        YotoAPI-->>App: Return existing uploadId (uploadUrl is empty)
    else New audio
        YotoAPI-->>App: Return uploadUrl (Presigned S3 PUT) & uploadId
        App->>S3: PUT audio binary directly to S3
        loop Poll until complete
            App->>YotoAPI: GET /media/upload/:uploadId/transcoded
            YotoAPI-->>App: Status (processing / completed)
        end
    end
    App->>YotoAPI: POST /content (Update playlist & chapter references)
```

## 6. Real-Time Player Connection (AWS IoT WebSockets)

Device telemetry and control utilize native browser WebSockets connected directly to AWS IoT Core:
- **Transport:** WebSocket over TLS (`wss://`)
- **Protocol:** MQTT 3.1.1
- **Authentication:** Custom authorizer (`?x-amz-customauthorizer-name=PublicJWTAuthorizer`) passing the JWT access token in the MQTT password.
- **Topics:**
  - `device/{deviceId}/data/status`: Battery, online state, ambient light status.
  - `device/{deviceId}/data/events`: Card insertion, playback state transitions.
  - `device/{deviceId}/command`: Remote control (play, pause, volume adjustment).

## 7. Multi-Provider Icon Ecosystem & Search Engine

Icon management uses a unified inverted indexing architecture detailed in:
- [RFC 011: Inverted Icon Indexing & Client-Side Search Engine](rfcs/011-inverted-icon-index-and-search.md)
- [RFC 012: Google Noto Emoji Icon Provider Integration](rfcs/012-noto-emoji-icon-provider.md)
- [RFC 013: Official Yoto Icon Provider Integration](rfcs/013-yoto-official-icon-provider.md)
- [RFC 014: Community Icon Provider Integration (yotoicons.com)](rfcs/014-yotoicons-community-integration.md)
- [RFC 021: Project Rebranding & Naming Strategy](rfcs/021-project-rebranding-and-naming-strategy.md)

**Core Principles:**
- Build-time generation builds a consolidated `icons-[hash].json` mapping keywords/stems to integer array offsets.
- Provides sub-millisecond query latency and offline capability.
- Fingerprinted 16×16 PNG assets served with immutable cache headers.
