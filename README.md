# YotoBench (`yoto-bench`)

A modern, responsive, client-side web application built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/) custom elements and `@lit-labs/router` for managing your [Yoto Player](https://yotoplay.com/) library directly in the browser.

`YotoBench` brings the power and precision of [`yotocli`](https://github.com/vgaro/yotocli) to anyone with a web browser—with zero installation, zero server infrastructure costs, and complete privacy.

## 🌟 Vision & Architecture Principles

1. **100% Client-Side / Serverless Architecture:**
   - Deployed as a static Single-Page Application (SPA) to **Netlify** with automatic PR deploy previews.
   - No backend database, microservices, or runtime servers to maintain, pay for, or keep patched.
2. **Direct Browser-to-API Communication:**
   - Direct OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication with Yoto's Auth0 identity service.
   - Dynamic ephemeral PR preview login supported via a canonical relay redirect.
   - Browser `fetch` calls directly to Yoto REST APIs (`api.yotoplay.com`) and signed direct-to-S3 audio uploads.
   - Real-time device status and control via browser WebSockets connecting to Yoto's AWS IoT MQTT broker.
3. **Rigorous Defense-in-Depth Security:**
   - Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) with `no-eval` and origin lockdown delivered via `<meta>`.
   - Subresource Integrity (SRI) on all compiled bundles (`integrity="sha384-..."`).
4. **Reactive State & Event-Driven UX:**
   - Powered by `@lit/context` and `@lit-labs/router` for persistent live WebSockets and uninterrupted background transfers.
   - Decoupled toast notifications via bubbling custom DOM events (`<yb-toast-manager>`).
5. **Standardized Reusable Widgets (`yb-` Prefix):**
   - Design system (`src/widgets/`) built with Lit custom elements (`<yb-button>`, `<yb-dialog>`, `<yb-dropdown>`, `<yb-pixel-icon>`) and scoped CSS tokens (`--yb-*`).
   - Self-hosted **Roboto** typography in WOFF2 bundles for offline speed and readability.
   - `<yb-pixel-icon>` standardizes 16×16 icon rendering using standard `<img>` tags with `image-rendering: pixelated` on a display contrast canvas.
6. **Practical Persistence & Privacy:**
   - Session & metadata stored simply in `localStorage`.
   - Large audio uploads and ZIP extractions streamed through the browser's Origin Private File System (OPFS).
   - Zero-cookie, privacy-first telemetry via the lightweight GA4 Measurement Protocol with complete PII redaction, an opt-out toggle, and full transparency page (`/privacy`).
7. **Instant, Zero-Latency Icon Search:**
   - Pre-indexed static catalogs of official Yoto icons and Google Noto Emoji assets served with content-addressable cache busting, delivering instantaneous offline search after the first hit.

## ✨ Planned Features

### 🎧 Card & Playlist Management
- **Visual Card Editor:** Inspect, create, and modify Make-Your-Own (MYO) playlist tracks and chapters.
- **Drag-and-Drop Ingestion:** Drop folders of audio files, zip archives (`@zip.js/zip.js`), or individual tracks straight into the browser to assemble or append to cards, with automated ID3 tag extraction (`music-metadata-browser`).
- **Controlled Concurrency:** Upload pipeline limited to max 3–4 parallel S3 streams to prevent network and browser saturation.
- **Card Synchronization:** Reorder tracks, update track titles, change cover art, and adjust card metadata.

### 🎙️ Smart Podcast RSS Importer
- **One-Click Feed Ingestion:** Paste an RSS podcast feed URL to generate or sync a Yoto playlist directly.
- **Feed Filtering Rules:**
  - Limit to the most recent $N$ or oldest $N$ episodes.
  - Exclude short promo/announcement clips (e.g. automatically skip episodes shorter than 2 minutes).
- **Metadata Persistence & Syncing:**
  - Persists import configuration directly into card metadata (e.g., custom description tags), allowing users to return anytime and click a single **"Sync New Episodes"** button to pick up newly released episodes without duplicating existing ones.

### 🎨 Fast, Multi-Provider Icon Picker
- **Interactive 16×16 Pixel Grid:** Preview icons in true Yoto display format.
- **Pre-Indexed Search:**
  - Embedded Google Noto Emoji library (Apache 2.0).
  - Official Yoto public icon library.
  - Future support for community icon integrations (e.g., [yotoicons.com](https://yotoicons.com)) pending maintainer alignment.
- **Automatic Auto-Suggest:** Contextual search based on track title and chapter keywords.
- **Custom Icon Upload:** Direct browser upload of custom 16×16 pixel art.

### 📱 Real-Time Device Status & Remote Control (`/device`)
- **Smart Device Routing:** Access `/device` to view all players; accounts with a single player automatically auto-select and navigate to `/device?id=<deviceId>`.
- **Live Hardware Telemetry:** View real-time battery percentages, charging indicators (⚡), online/offline status badges, volume levels, active card titles, and firmware metadata over AWS IoT WebSockets.
- **Card Playback Remote:** Trigger card playback directly onto your player via a visual card picker modal, with Play, Pause, and Stop transport controls.
